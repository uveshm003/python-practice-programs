print("--- Python User Input Assignment ---")

# --- Section 1: Basic Input ---

print("\n--- Section 1: Basic Input ---")

# 1.1 Getting Simple String Input:
#    - Ask the user for their name and store it in a variable called 'name'.
#    - Print a greeting message using the entered name (e.g., "Hello, [name]!").

# Your code here:
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# 1.2 Getting Numerical Input (Initial Attempt):
#    - Ask the user for their age and store it in a variable called 'age_str'.
#    - Print the entered age.
#    - What is the datatype of 'age_str'? Verify using `type()`.

# Your code here:
age_str = input("Please enter your age: ")
print(f"Your age is: {age_str}")
print(f"Datatype of age_str: {type(age_str)}")
# Explanation: The input() function always returns a string.

# --- Section 2: Converting Input Datatypes ---

print("\n--- Section 2: Converting Input Datatypes ---")

# 2.1 Converting String to Integer:
#    - Ask the user to enter their age again.
#    - Convert the input to an integer using `int()` and store it in a variable called 'age_int'.
#    - Print the age and verify its datatype using `type()`.

# Your code here:
age_str_again = input("Please enter your age again: ")
age_int = int(age_str_again)
print(f"Your age (as integer): {age_int}")
print(f"Datatype of age_int: {type(age_int)}")

# 2.2 Converting String to Float:
#    - Ask the user to enter a floating-point number.
#    - Convert the input to a float using `float()` and store it in a variable called 'float_num'.
#    - Print the number and verify its datatype.

# Your code here:
float_str = input("Please enter a floating-point number: ")
float_num = float(float_str)
print(f"You entered: {float_num}")
print(f"Datatype of float_num: {type(float_num)}")

# --- Section 3: Handling Potential Errors (try-except) ---

print("\n--- Section 3: Handling Potential Errors (try-except) ---")

# 3.1 Handling ValueError for Integer Conversion:
#    - Ask the user to enter their age.
#    - Use a `try-except` block to handle the case where the user enters non-numeric input.
#    - If a `ValueError` occurs, print an error message.
#    - If the conversion is successful, print the age.

# Your code here:
while True:
    age_input_safe = input("Please enter your age (numeric): ")
    try:
        age_safe = int(age_input_safe)
        print(f"Your age is: {age_safe}")
        break  # Exit the loop if input is valid
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number for your age.")

# 3.2 Handling ValueError for Float Conversion:
#    - Ask the user to enter a price.
#    - Use a `try-except` block to handle non-numeric input and print an appropriate error message.
#    - If successful, print the price.

# Your code here:
while True:
    price_input = input("Please enter a price (e.g., 10.50): ")
    try:
        price = float(price_input)
        print(f"The price is: {price}")
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number for the price.")

# --- Section 4: Getting Multiple Inputs ---

print("\n--- Section 4: Getting Multiple Inputs ---")

# 4.1 Getting Space-Separated Input:
#    - Ask the user to enter two numbers separated by a space (e.g., "5 10").
#    - Read the input, split it into two strings, convert them to integers, and store them in variables 'num_a' and 'num_b'.
#    - Print the sum of 'num_a' and 'num_b'.

# Your code here:
two_numbers_str = input("Enter two numbers separated by a space: ")
num_a_str, num_b_str = two_numbers_str.split()
num_a = int(num_a_str)
num_b = int(num_b_str)
print(f"The sum of {num_a} and {num_b} is: {num_a + num_b}")

# 4.2 Getting Comma-Separated Input:
#    - Ask the user to enter three colors separated by commas (e.g., "red,green,blue").
#    - Read the input, split it into a list of color strings, and print the list.

# Your code here:
colors_str = input("Enter three colors separated by commas: ")
color_list = colors_str.split(',')
print(f"The colors you entered are: {color_list}")

# --- Section 5: Input with Prompts and Formatting ---

print("\n--- Section 5: Input with Prompts and Formatting ---")

# 5.1 Using f-strings in Prompts:
#    - Ask the user for their favorite color using an f-string prompt that includes their name (obtained earlier).

# Your code here:
favorite_color = input(f"{name}, what is your favorite color? ")
print(f"Your favorite color is: {favorite_color}")

# 5.2 Formatting Output with User Input:
#    - Ask the user for the name of a product and its price.
#    - Print a formatted string displaying the product name and price with two decimal places.

# Your code here:
product_name = input("Enter the name of a product: ")
while True:
    try:
        product_price_str = input(f"Enter the price of {product_name}: ")
        product_price = float(product_price_str)
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid price. Please enter a valid number.")

print(f"The price of {product_name} is: â‚¹{product_price:.2f}")

# --- Section 6: Advanced Input Handling (Optional) ---

print("\n--- Section 6: Advanced Input Handling (Optional) ---")

# 6.1 Validating Input within a Loop:
#    - Ask the user to enter a number between 1 and 10 (inclusive).
#    - Use a `while` loop to keep asking until a valid number is entered.

# Your code here:
while True:
    valid_num_str = input("Enter a number between 1 and 10 (inclusive): ")
    try:
        valid_num = int(valid_num_str)
        if 1 <= valid_num <= 10:
            print(f"You entered a valid number: {valid_num}")
            break
        else:
            print("Number is out of the valid range. Please try again.")
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")

# 6.2 Getting Password Input (Security Consideration):
#    - Import the `getpass` module.
#    - Use `getpass.getpass()` to securely get a password from the user (the input will be hidden).
#    - Print a message indicating that the password has been received (do not print the actual password).

# Your code here:
import getpass

password = getpass.getpass("Enter your password: ")
print("Password received securely.")
# Important Note: In real applications, you should never print or store passwords directly.

# 6.3 Handling Multiple Exceptions:
#    - Ask the user to enter a number.
#    - Use a single `try` block with multiple `except` clauses to handle both `ValueError` (if input is not a number)
#      and potentially other exceptions (though not explicitly anticipated here).

# Your code here:
number_input_multi_except = input("Enter a number: ")
try:
    processed_number = int(number_input_multi_except) * 2
    print(f"The number multiplied by 2 is: {processed_number}")
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
